General Illustration Figure 0.1 shows the the general process to run the tool. Users select the disorder type, where the data come from (State), and then upload the input file to the online tool. The detailed description about input data file format can be found at Section 2. After clicking the Run RUSP_RF button, there will be a figure and a tale shown on the right of the page. Users can check the details of the reulst at Section 4. Figure 0.1: How to run the tool "],
["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction", " Chapter 1 Introduction Newborn screening (NBS) is one of the most successful public health programs to identify newborns with different disorders that can be treated. There are more than 40 metabolic disorders on the Recommended Universal Screening Panel (RUSP) can be detected with metabolic data using mass spectrometry (MS/MS) method from dried blood spots collected by heel stick shortly after birth. While successful in most respects, only a few biomarkers are used for each disorder in NBS with sensitivity favored over specificity, which leads to relatively high false positive rate in NBS. In order to reduce the number of false positives, we proposed to take a second-tier test for the newborns with screen-positive results in NBS. RUSP_RF is an online tool based on random forest (Breiman 2001) method to reduce false positive rate by incorporating data form multiple metabolic analytes. References "],
["dataformat.html", "Chapter 2 Input Data Format 2.1 Disorder Type 2.2 State 2.3 Metabolic information", " Chapter 2 Input Data Format The online tool requires 3 kinds of inputs: disorder type, state, and metabolic information. 2.1 Disorder Type Disorder type can be specified by choosing the corresponding item on the sidebar. While navigating to a new disease type, a popup dialog with the text “If you choose to continue, the current input file and the results will be cleared. Please download the results beforehand if you prefer to keep a record.” will appear. If the user choose to ‘continue’, the application will clear all current data and switch to the corresponding model. 2.2 State State can be specified by choosing the corresponding item on the sidebar. The current model is based on the data from California. Because of the difference of NBS project between different states, the model may not fit the data out side of California. Please contact us if you want to include model from your state. 2.3 Metabolic information The input data file could be in a comma separated values (csv) format, or in a plain text format with its delimiters being one of the following: semicolon, tab, or space. The first row of the file contains the header information for each column. Each row after the header contains the corresponding information of each sample. The description and format of each column are described below. As long as all the 39 marker levels are included in the file, the metabolic markers can be in any order depending on your preference. Column 1 2-40 Headers id Original marker name or its abbreviation Example Headers ID, sample Citrulline, cit, C18:1, c181, C5-OH, C5OH Values Unique sample id (string) Individual marker concentration levels (numeric) Example Values S01, sample_001 0.2, 0.11421383 "],
["methods.html", "Chapter 3 Methods", " Chapter 3 Methods The online tool adopted random forest (Breiman 2001) to reduce false positive rate by incorporating data form multiple metabolic analytes. There are many trees in a random forest model and each tree has a vote in a binary classification. We defined a probability as the fraction of out of bag (OOB) votes for true positive. If the probaiblity is larger than a cutoff, the sample is classified as true positive. By defaulty, 0.5 is used as the cutoff in random forest. However, the sample size is unbalanced in our data. We need to change the default cutoff for each disorder for the online tool. We repeated the 10 fold cross validation for 1000 times and choose the cutoff at which we can get the same sensitivity as the state criteria. The final cut off is chosen as the median of all the cutoffs of the 1000 repeats. References "],
["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results", " Chapter 4 Results The results of the tool are shown in the right of the page: a boxplot on the top and a table on the bottom. The boxplot (Figure 4.1) shows the distribution of the probability (fraction of votes) for each sample calculated from LOOCV in false and true positive groups. The estimation of the probability for the input samples is shown in the center of the boxplot. Users have to choose a cutoff for the probability to decide true positives. In order to help users to make the decision, we have a suggested cutoff as the default in the online tool. Figure 4.1: Boxplot in results The table (Figure 4.2) includes 4 columns: sample id, probability (fraction of votes), result from suggested (default) cutoof, and result from user selected cutoff.
