General Illustration Figure 0.1 shows the general process to run the tool. Users select the disorder type, where the data come from (State), and then upload the input file to the online tool. The detailed description about input data file format can be found at Section 2. After clicking the Run RUSP_RF button, there will be a figure and a tale shown on the right of the page. Users can check the details of the result at Section 4. Figure 0.1: How to run the tool "],
["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction", " Chapter 1 Introduction Newborn screening (NBS) is one of the most successful public health programs to identify newborns with different disorders that can be treated. There are more than 40 metabolic disorders on the Recommended Universal Screening Panel (RUSP) can be detected with metabolic data using mass spectrometry (MS/MS) method from dried blood spots collected by heel stick shortly after birth. While successful in most respects, only a few biomarkers are used for each disorder in NBS with sensitivity favored over specificity, which leads to relatively high false positive rate in NBS. In order to reduce the number of false positives, we proposed to take a second-tier test for the newborns with screen-positive results in NBS. RUSP_RF is an online tool based on random forest (Breiman 2001) method to reduce false positive rate by incorporating data form multiple metabolic analytes. References "],
["dataformat.html", "Chapter 2 Input Data Format 2.1 Disorder Type 2.2 NBS Program 2.3 Metabolic Information 2.4 A Full List of Acceptable Header Fields", " Chapter 2 Input Data Format The online tool requires 3 kinds of inputs: Disorder Type, NBS Program, and Metabolic Information. 2.1 Disorder Type Disorder type can be specified by choosing the corresponding item on the sidebar. There are four disorders included in the application currently: GA-1(Glutaric Acidemia Type I), MMA(Methylmalonic Acidemia), OTCD(Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency), and VLCADD(Very Long-chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency). 2.2 NBS Program NBS program, which indicates the place where the data is collected from, can be specified by choosing the corresponding item on the sidebar. The current model is based on data from California. Different states or countries may have different NBS programs, the model may not fit the data outside of California. Please contact us if you would like to cooperate with our team and include the model for your state or country. 2.3 Metabolic Information The input data file could be in a comma separated values (csv) format, or in a plain text format with its delimiters being one of the following: semicolon, tab, or space. The first row of the file contains the header information for each column. Each row after the header contains the corresponding information of each sample. The description and format of each column are described below. The headers are case insensitive. As long as all the 39 marker levels are included in the file, they can be in any order depending on your preference. Column 1 2-40 Headers id Original marker name or its abbreviation Example Headers ID, sample Citrulline, cit, C18:1, c181, C5-OH, C5OH Values Unique sample id (string) Individual marker concentration levels (numeric) Example Values S01, sample_001 0.2, 0.11421383 2.4 A Full List of Acceptable Header Fields This table aims to list all the headers, and describe the alternatives that are acceptable in the application.

["methods.html", "Chapter 3 Methods", " Chapter 3 Methods The online tool adopted random forest (Breiman 2001) to reduce false positive rate by incorporating information from multiple metabolic analytes. There are many trees in a random forest model and each tree has a vote in a binary classification. We defined the RF Score as the fraction of votes for true positive. The ROC curve is drawn from the RF Score. There is a direct correlation between RF Score and sensitivity. In this case we decided to use sensitivity as the cutoff to separate true positives and false positives in random forest. In order to decide the default cutoff, we repeated the 10-fold cross validation for 1000 times and calculated RF Score at which we can get the same sensitivity as the state NBS program for each repeat. The median of RF Score is considered at which we can get expected sensitivity as the state NBS program. References "],
["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results", " Chapter 4 Results The results of the tool are shown in the right of the page: a boxplot on the top and a table on the bottom. The boxplot (Figure 4.1) shows the distribution of the RF score for each sample calculated from LOOCV in false and true positive groups. The RF score for the input samples is shown in the center of the boxplot. Users need to choose a cutoff of sensitivity that correlates with RF score directly. In order to help users to make the decision, we have a suggested cutoff as the default in the online tool. The suggested cutoff is described in Section 3. Users can also choose the cutoff according to their data. The suggested cutoff is shown as solid line while the cutoff chosen by the users are shown in dash line. When users change the cutoff of sensitivity, an estimation of specificity is shown under the slider. There are numbers at the bottom of the boxplot. In Figure 4.1, the number for the false positive is “311/502=62.0%” and the number for the true positive is “2/103 = 1.9%”, which indicates that 302 (62.0%) out of 502 false positives in the training data will remain as false positive while 2 (1.9%) out of 103 true positive will be categorized as false negative with user selected cutoff. In other words, we could remove 192 (38%) false positives and 2 false negatives (there are 4 false negatives with state criteria) from the dataset. Random forest removes false positives without introducing false negatives; in other words, it can yield second-tier NBS test results with higher specificity without reducing sensitivity. Figure 4.1: Boxplot in results The table (Figure 4.2) includes 4 columns: sample id, RF score, results from suggested (default) cutoff, and results from user selected cutoff.
