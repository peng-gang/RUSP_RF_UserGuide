The online tool adopted random forest [@breiman2001random] to reduce false positive rate by incorporating information form multiple metabolic analytes. 

There are many *trees* in a random forest model and each *tree* has a *vote* in a binary classification. We defined the *__RF Score__* as the fraction of *votes* for true positive. The ROC curve is draw from the *__RF Score__*. There is a direct correlation between *__RF Score__* and sensitivity. In this case we decided to use sensitivity as the cutoff to seperate ture positives and false postives in random forest.

Inorder to decide the default cutoff, we repeated the 10 fold cross validation for 1000 times and calculated *__RF Score__* at which we can get the same sensitivity as the state NBS program for each repeat. The median of *__RF Score__* is considered at which we can get expected sensitivity as the state NBS program.
